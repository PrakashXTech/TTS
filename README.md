**Text-to-Speech (TTS) Web Application**
This web application converts written text into speech using the browser's built-in SpeechSynthesis API. It also features voice control, pitch, volume, and rate adjustments, as well as a seeker bar that allows users to track and control the progress of the speech.

**Features**
**Voice Selection**: Choose from a list of available voices in your browser.
**Volume Control:** Adjust the volume of the speech output.
**Rate Control:** Adjust the speed at which the text is spoken.
**Pitch Control**: Modify the pitch for a higher or lower tone.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the input text into speech and speaks it aloud.
Seeker Progress Bar: Track the speech progress and seek to a specific position in the text.
Pause/Resume/Cancel: Control the speech synthesis with pause, resume, and cancel functionality.
Download MP3: Save the text as an MP3 file (client-side limitation, this will download the text as audio data).
Restore Previous Text: Automatically saves the text entered and allows restoring it after a session.
